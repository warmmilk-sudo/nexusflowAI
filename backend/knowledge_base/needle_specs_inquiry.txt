Subject: Inquiry about AI Epic™ Co-Ablation System Probe Specifications

Dear Sales Team,

I am Dr. James Wilson, Chief of Interventional Oncology at Metropolitan Medical Center. We are currently evaluating cryoablation systems for our expanding tumor ablation program.

I have some specific questions about your AI Epic™ Co-Ablation System:

1. What are the available probe diameters and lengths? We primarily treat liver and kidney tumors ranging from 2-5cm.

2. Can you provide details about the temperature range and ice ball formation characteristics?

3. What imaging modalities are compatible with your system? We primarily use CT and MRI guidance.

4. Do you have clinical data comparing outcomes with traditional argon-helium systems?

5. What is the typical procedure time for a 3cm liver lesion?

We are particularly interested in the dual-modality (freeze + heat) technology and how it compares to our current radiofrequency ablation system.

Could we schedule a demonstration at our facility? We perform approximately 150 ablation procedures annually.

Best regards,
Dr. James Wilson, MD
